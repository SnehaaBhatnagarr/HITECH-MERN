    <h4 style="color: rgb(94, 81, 151);">As a BTech student with a strong interest in technology and creativity, I gained hands-on experience during my internship in Android development and Firebase integration. I learned to build user-friendly interfaces, troubleshoot layout issues, and implement secure login systems using Java, XML, and Firebase. I also improved my debugging and problem-solving skills while working on real-time applications. This internship enhanced my understanding of app functionality, UI/UX design, and backend integration, preparing me to take on more complex development tasks in the future. In addition, I am currently completing a web development course, which will be finished this month, further strengthening my skills in creating responsive and dynamic websites.</h4>
